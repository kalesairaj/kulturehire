# Career Aspiration for Gen Z - Internship Project

This project was part of my internship experience with **KultureHire**, a platform focused on bridging the gap between education and industry needs by providing hands-on, real-world challenges.

During this internship, I had the opportunity to work on data-driven problem statements that reflect actual business scenarios. The project helped me enhance my skills in:

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
- **Data Analysis using Excel and PostgreSQL**
- **Creating Dashboards in Power BI**
- **Presenting insights through storytelling**
- **Solving real-world business problems**

It was a great learning experience that improved my understanding of the data lifecycle, from raw data to meaningful insights.
